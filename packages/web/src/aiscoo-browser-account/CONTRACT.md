# Browser New API account

This adapter owns browser credentials for the local loopback Web mode. Its public surface is `index.ts` and `contract.ts`; all service imports are types. It uses shared wire schemas, the `xwork-cli` client, and the existing RPC emitter. No Node, CLI, keyring, navigation, or UI dependency is introduced.

One canonical New API origin selects one atomic localStorage record containing the validated bundle and a cryptographically random safe integer authGeneration. The generation is public owner metadata, stable across refresh and page reload. Only `/me` can confirm a user/SID for login or restore. `getOwner()` is synchronous and initially null; the attachment must await `oauth.restoreCachedSessionState()` before publishing owner. Each read also checks persisted generation. Main may call restore on storage events.

  participant P as Page account owner
  participant S as Browser storage
  participant N as Same-origin proxy
  P->>S: Store tab-local state/verifier, 5 minute deadline
  P->>S: Consume pending before first code exchange
  P->>N: Exchange code once, then confirm /me
  P->>S: Web Lock; compare generation and commit bundle+generation
  P-->>P: Publish owner and signed-in
  P->>S: Web Lock; reread record, refresh once, compare generation
  P->>S: Commit stable owner/relay with rotated refresh token
  P->>S: Logout: synchronously clear record and increment page revision
  P-->>P: Clear owner and publish signed-out before network
  P->>N: Revoke captured SID without waiting for refresh lock
```

Pending proof survives same-tab navigation in sessionStorage. Callback syntax is the shared exact loopback grammar; arbitrary return targets are rejected. Concurrent identical callbacks share one exchange; consumed proof is never retried. Every asynchronous completion checks page revision and persisted generation before publication or returning credentials. Logout and invalidation bypass a held refresh lock so a slow network cannot delay local signout. Same-origin JS storage operations are synchronous; the generation check and commit have no intervening await.

Network errors preserve recoverable storage and return an unavailable restore result. Confirmed invalid sessions and refresh ownership violations clear only the captured generation. Logout errors surface fixed codes after local signout. Dispose invalidates page work and the event subscription source, preserving storage and pending proof for reload. It does not revoke a remote SID.

The existing WebCallbackPage receives a main-owned wrapper mapping a session callback to `{userInfo, appReturnTo: '/'}`. This module does not implement attachment, Server readiness, proxy configuration, or cross-tab event registration. It does not retry code exchange or add a background refresh loop. Uncommitted exchanges and displaced sessions receive a best-effort revoke using only their captured SID and refresh token; cleanup failure does not overwrite the accepted browser owner. Browser or server E2E is required separately from these contract and concurrency unit tests.
